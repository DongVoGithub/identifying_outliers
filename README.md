I first clean and reduce the data to only essentials.
The following the progress in SQL queries, I chose 3 types of values for considering outliers: standard deviation, coefficient of variation and outlier count, using average salary to calculate them.
I then categorized the data into classes (A,B and C) and chose only the top contendors.
I then chose top 5 departments with the highest outliers by considering top of each types in order (coefficient of variation, standard devation and outlier count) and with at least 2 types of values included.
